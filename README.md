This project is an adaptation of the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). Its primary objective is to serve as a case study of how to build a real world application using a combination of serverless technologies and approaches. The project captures key architectural components, code structure, deployment techniques, testing approaches, and operational practices of the AWS Serverless Application Repository - a production-grade AWS service, written in Java and built using serverless technologies. It is comprised of 4 components.
